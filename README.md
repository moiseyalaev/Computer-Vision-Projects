# Computer-Vision-Projects
A collection of computer vision problems tackled usinga variety of different Computer Vision Methods

I was first inspired to start exploring Computer Vision implementations after doing the CNN
Research paper. This was a great way for me to see the math come to life and for me to make use
of my theoretical mathematical background. After working so much with TF, these mini projects
led me to persue Google's TensorFlow Developer Certification Exam. 

The progression of complexity in both models and concepts applied from simplest to most complex are 
as follows:
1. Basic_CovNet
2. Convolution_in_Depth
3. ImageDataGenerator
4. Multiclass_RockPaperScissor
5. Real_ImgGen_Cat_or_Dog

Thank you for taking an interest in my learning and exploration process!
